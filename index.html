      <h1>Kevin Merrington</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Harare, Zimbabwe, where I attended school before moving to Cape Town at the age of 19.</p>
      <p>In Cape Town, I studied a achelor's degree in Financial Management before moving to Grahamstwon to further my stidies with an honuors degree at rhodes university.</p>
      <p>During my these years in South Africa, I met my wife and we ended up getting married on a wine farm in South Afica in 2018.</p>
      <p>We moved back to my wifes home country, Norway, and lived in Oslo. Here I started applying for finance related jobs, but without speaking Norwegian it was difficult.</p>
      <p>I ended up working in the service industry, both in a cafe and a wine bar, until my son was born in early 2021. Once he came along, the late work hours were no longer manageable for both me and my wife.</p>
      <p>I decided to enroll in an online bachelor of data science degree which I could do from home which was convieniant with a one year old.</p>
      <p>After the first year, I started to realise that I was more interesed in web development than data science, and started learning web development on my own.</p>
      <p>I have now decided to discontinued the online bachelors degree and instead focus on web development and finding an entry level job.</p>
      <p>This website is where I will be showing off my projects and skills that I have learned.</p>
      <P>I hope you find it interesting! Please get in contact if you want to chat!</P>
